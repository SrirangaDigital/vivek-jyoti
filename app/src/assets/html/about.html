			<h1>About the Bhavan's Journal</h1>
			<p>Bhavan's Journal, an English fortnightly, devoted to life, literature and culture was started in 1954. It has come to be recognised as one of the most widely read magazines of our country, having a vast and enlightened readership in India and abroad. Distinguished thinkers and writers continue to contribute to it.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<h2>From the first issue of the journal, 15 August 1954</h2>
				<p>With this issue begins the ‘Book University Journal’ which the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan hopes will fulfill a long felt need. In view of the Bhavan's branches, departments and memberships, its varied activities and the activities of its allied organisations like the Sanskrit Vishva Parishad, some of which have International contacts, the Bhavan needs a journal which would keep all those connected with the Bhavan directly or indirectly in touch with all these activities.</p>
				<p>I welcome the BOOK UNIVERSITY JOURNAL now being published by the Bhavan. I hope that it will constitute a further stage in the Bhavan's progress. Bharat has a heritage and a mission in history. It should be the privilege of this journal to interpret this heritage and be the instrument of its mission.</p>
