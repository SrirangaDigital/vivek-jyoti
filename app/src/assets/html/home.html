					<p><strong>President<br />Surendralal G. Mehta</strong></p>
					<p>The Period of the first thirteen years of the twenty-first century has seen that the information available to mankind had become double that of all the information that was available to it during the whole of the twentieth century. While this awesome increase has enabled people to upgrade and fine-tune facilities and comforts at the physical level, in terms of meaningful existence, purpose, contentment, tranquility and peace of mind, we seem to have taken quite a few steps backwards.</p>
					<p>Bhavan itself was founded by Dr. K. M. Munshi  because he was concerned with changes that were perceptible, seventy-five years ago which prompted him to establish it for resuscitation and propagation of culture and ethical values. We find that there is greater need for an institution like Bhavan now, more than ever before. While Bhavan has grown and expanded, it has to intensify its efforts now to a much greater extent and it is doing so.</p>
					<p>Among the various vehicles which Bhavan employs to carry forward its mission are its books, publication and periodicals. The most important and effective among them is its English fortnightly, BHAVANS JOURNAL, which also maintains principles of ethical journalism.</p>
					<p>The contents of its issues, from its very first issue onwards, are of relevance at all times unlike in the case of other periodicals which are of interest to people only till the arrival of their subsequent issues. A hundred years from now, contents of issues of Bhavan's Journal however, will remain to be of interest and relevance.</p>
					<p>I am very happy, therefore, that Bhavan's Mysore Kendra has taken the initiative to bring out collections of issues of Bhavan's Journal from its first issue in the form a CD. I am quite sure that it will find itself to be a well sought after source of knowledge for eternally relevant values and culture.</p>
